Pro version of mplayer offers new assesable activities on video tjat makes the mplayer
an interactive video based learning module.

Avtivity types:

### Highlighted zones finding (bumping).

The teacher prepares a set of timestamped defined highlight time segments within the
video duration. The student does not see any of those highlights and is proposed to 
identify them on base of the mplayer instructions (notes or description).

the student plays the video and has a bumper to mark "it's here". The mplayer records
for each student the number of bumps (may affect the final grade), and reveals
the highlight segment if bumped inside.

At the end of the play, a grade is computed on how many highlighted segments were discovered
in the clip. the grade is affected down if there are many unsuccessfull attempts to bump. The max
grade is obtained (100%) if all highlight zones where matched without failed bumps. A failed 
bump with affect the grade depending on a mplayer parameter, it can be less or more severe, 
removing more or less grade units per fail.

At the moment of the POC, only one attempt is stored. the student MAY or MAY NOT be
allowed to repeat the test.

Grading options :
- ignore fails : count found zones over all existing. grade proportionally
- ignore fails shifted : id but the amount of matched zones providing the 100% score is lower than the amount of highlight zones.
- fails minusgrade : each fail looses some % of grade.
- nofail : No fail allowed. One fail nullifies.

### Sequence marking match

Based on similar setup of the teacher, some highlighted sections of the video are prepared
teacher side.

The student is asked to punch-in-out some zones he considers matching with the instructions.
the student can play, punch in, punch out, stop, eventually remove some segments, until submits
for assessment.

when finished to play and mark, a comparison is made between the teacher and the student's markpoints
and a intersection score is computed. Score is maximum is both marking full match with a certain
error shift admitted. Score will decrease when match surface diverges on both sides : the student may have 
marked more, less length, or same lengh but non matching.

Grading options :
-match/unmatch : Just counts match/unmatch
-match/unmatch + segment count assessment

Match = L(INTER) / L(UNION)

simul : 
I     U      Match
100   100    1
100   150    0,666
0     200    0

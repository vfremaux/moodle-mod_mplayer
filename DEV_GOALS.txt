MPlayer aims to be a versatile and full featured video player 
integration for Moodle.

It offers two major open source integration as flowplayer and JW Player.

flow^player is already integrated but with minimal features as standard player 
for links on video through the multimediafilter. But this offsers very few options, 
no play list, no cue points, no thumbnails.

Flowplayer and JW player are offered for convenience for an admin prefering
offerring one of both players.

Thus the set of options when configuring is colliding at the moment. We would like
to be clearer in the option given for either on or the other player.

some developement tracks may be complex, such are reloading dynamically the mod_form.php form
when changing the player technology choice. At the moment, this choice is made in global settings
for the whole platform. Reloading the mod_form.php could allow each instance to provide either technologies
as a choice result of the teacher.

Some points are not clearly set up at the moment

1. JW player is not working at the moment. Finish implement JW support

2. Cue lists are unhandled or potentially not collected correctly in the instance attribute set. Maybe
even this is a reliquate of the older JW implementation that was at the origin.

3. Clarify the settings, being sure Flowplayer and JW settings are acurate and adequate for the 
used player.

4. add support to external video URLs, in addition to uploaded content.

5. Add support to streaming configuration, when supported.

6. Add better support of GUI colouring support, move this paramtric support to central settings (the video colour
choice is likely consistant with global theme choices).

7. M27 version should be build, rebuilding logging code with events

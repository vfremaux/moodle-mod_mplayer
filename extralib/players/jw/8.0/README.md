## A Simple Example

The example below will render a video player into the div with the `player` id, listens to an event, and makes a few calls using the API.

````html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <script src='LINK_TO_YOUR_PLAYER'></script>
    <script>jwplayer.key='YOUR_KEY';</script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="player">Loading the player...</div>
    <script>
        // Setup the player
        const player = jwplayer('player').setup({
            file: 'LINK_TO_YOUR_FILE.mp4'
        });

        // Listen to an event
        player.on('pause', (event) => {
            alert('Why did my user pause their video instead of watching it?');
        });

        // Call the API
        const bumpIt = () => {
            const vol = player.getVolume();
            player.setVolume(vol + 10);
        }
        bumpIt();
    </script>
</body>
</html>

## Contributing

We appreciate all contributions towards the player! Before submitting an issue or PR, please see our contributing docs [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Building the Player

We use `grunt` and a few `npm scripts` to build the player, lint code, and run tests. Debug code is built to `/bin-debug`, while minified & uglified code is built to `/bin-release`. Code is built with `webpack`, linted with `eslint`, and tested with `karma`, `mocha` and `chai`.

#### Requirements:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download) and npm

#### Steps:

1. Fork the project, clone your fork, and set up the remotes:
````bash
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/jwplayer
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory
cd jwplayer
# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
git remote add upstream https://github.com/jwplayer/jwplayer
````

2. Install the dependencies:
````bash
# Install grunt globally
npm install -g grunt
npm install
# Optionally, install webpack-dev-server
npm install -g webpack-dev-server
````
 
3. Build the player:
````bash
# Build once
grunt
# Complete Watch - builds JS, lints, and tests on each change
grunt serve
# Quick JS Watch - build only. Requires webpack-dev-server to be installed globally
webpack-dev-server -w --env.debug --port 8888 --output-public-path /bin-debug/
````
 
4. Test your code:
````bash
# All browsers
grunt test
# Individual browsers - chrome, firefox, ie11, ie10, ie9
grunt karma:{BROWSER} e.g. grunt karma:chrome
````
 
5. Lint your code:
````bash
npm run lint
````

6. Setup git pre-push hook
# Will lint and run unit tests on the branch before any push to remote
````bash
grunt hooks
````

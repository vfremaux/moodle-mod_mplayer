Redrawn for Moodle 2 by Valery Fremaux (valery.fremaux@gmail.com)

This version is a preliminary publication after formal review.  This is yet a beta version where we tried to rearchitecture
main features. Documentation writing and review is in progress. There are advanced features that are not yet fully tested
such as simple dealing with streamers or pseudo-streaming. A further package may clean the "bad ideas" options when we can
finish the complete qualification.

Our final goal is to provide an economic minimal viable way for small institutions to diffuse a reasonable set of videos with
a very simple as possible, lightweight and costless solution. 

Do not be to greedy anyway : video and live media are very complex and heavy technologies that fully justify the "cost of service"
of major providers such as Kaltura, Livemedia or other professional providers. This plugin has limited goals and no service garantees
as being free development initiative. It will probably be in "on progress" status driven by our internal needs and challenges.

Design Notes
===============

The .stm format

STM files are manifests that are used as proxy descriptors for remotely dispatched medias. 
the effective media file may be stored into an extra storage out of control of Moodle and
may be delivered from a streamed URL. the manifest file should be usually built by the MPlayer 
module, after a media upload. the manifest file is an XML file with a simple internal schema :

<XML version="1.0">
<Video>
    <Source>
        <streamer>wowza</streamer>
        <streamerurl>rtmp://medias.mysite/com</streamerurl>
        <appication>/vod</application>
        <clip>0</clip>
        <location>mp4:streamedfile.mp4</location>
    </Source>
</Video>

when passing this version, logs have been fixed at write time. Older logs should be reprocessed to
match correct cmid reference.

use /mod/mplayer/cli/fix_logs_v2020042801.php script to reprocess. Note that this reprocess may need a
lot of time if the log table is big.
